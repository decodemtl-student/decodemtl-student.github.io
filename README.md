This is my first webpage!
=========================

These are the technologies that I'm using:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

I am learning this stuff thru [DecodeMTL](http://www.decodemtl.com)

I initialized this project in the following way:

1. `git init`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'Initial Commit'`
4. `git remote add origin git@github.com:decodemtl-student/decodemtl-student.github.io.git`
5. `git push -u origin master`

I updated this project in the following way:

1. Make some change to the page
2. `git add index.html` (or whatever file you changed)
3. `git commit -m "changed job title"`
4. `git push`
